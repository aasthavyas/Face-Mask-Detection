# Face-Mask-Detection
The end of 2019 witnessed the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),
which has continued to be the cause of plight for millions of lives and businesses
even in 2020. As the world recovers from the pandemic and plans to return to a state
of normalcy, there is a wave of anxiety among all individuals, especially those who
intend to resume in- person activity. Studies have proved that wearing a face mask
significantly reduces the risk of viral transmission as well as provides a sense of
protection. However, it is not feasible to manually track the implementation of this
policy. Technology holds the key here. We introduce a Deep Learning based system
that can detect instances where face masks are not used properly. Our system consists
of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture capable of detecting masked
and unmasked faces. These can further be integrated with pre-installed CCTV
cameras. This will help track safety violations, promote the use of face masks, and
ensure a safe working environment.

## Development Environment
This project has been developed on python using Anaconda and Jupyter notebooks.
Python libraries used are Os, Matplotlib, OpenCV, Numpy, TensorFlow, Keras and
OpenCV.
In the system, Convolutional Neural Networks architecture will be used along with uses of OpenCV, Cascade
classifier, Keras and TensorFlow.

## Dataset
The dataset - [link](https://data-flair.training/blogs/download-face-mask-data/). 1314 training images and 194 test images divided into two catgories, with and without mask.
