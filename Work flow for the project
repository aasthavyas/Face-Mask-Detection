System Design

Steps followed for this project:
Step 1: Data Visualization
In the first step, we visualised the total number of images in our dataset in both
categories.
Step 2: Splitting the data
In this step, we split our data into the training set which will contain the images on
which the CNN model will be trained and the test set with the images on which our
model will be tested.
In this, we take split_size =0.8, which means that 80% of the total images will go to
the training set and the remaining 20% of the images will go to the test set.
Step 3: Building the Model
In the next step, we build our Sequential CNN model with various layers such as
Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dropout and Dense. In the last Dense layer, we use
the ‘softmax’ function to output a vector that gives the probability of each of the two
classes.
Step 4: Pre-Training the CNN model
After building our model, we fit them to our model in the next step.
Step 5: Training the CNN model
This step is the main step where we fit our images in the training set and the test set
to our Sequential model we built using keras library. We have trained the model for
20 epochs (iterations). However, we can train for more number of epochs to attain
higher accuracy lest there occurs over-fitting.
Step 6: Importing the Face detection Program
After this, we intend to use it to detect if we are wearing a face mask using our PC’s
webcam.
Step 7: Detecting the Faces with and without Masks
In the last step, we use the OpenCV library to run an infinite loop to use our web
camera in which we detect the face using the Cascade Classifier.
