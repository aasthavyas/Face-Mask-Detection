# What work has been done

Step 1: Digital Pre-processing our dataset
Digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to perform image
processing on digital images. As a subfield of digital signal processing, digital image
processing has many advantages over analogue image processing. It allows a much
wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data.
the aim of digital image processing is to improve the image data (features) by
suppressing unwanted distortions and/or enhancement of some important image
features so that our AI-Computer Vision models can benefit from this improved data
to work on.
Step 2: Building Convolutional Neural Network

1. Our first 2 layers are Conv2D layers. These are convolution layers that will deal
with our input images, which are seen as 2-dimensional matrices. 100 in the first
layer and 200 in the second layer are the number of nodes in each layer.

2. Activation is the activation function for the layer. The activation function we will
be using for our first 2 layers is the ReLU, or Rectified Linear Activation.
3. We add a 2D max pooling layer. Specify the size of the pooling in the x and y
directions â€“ (2, 2) and stride of (1,1)
4. In between the Conv2D layers and the dense layer, there is a Flatten layer. Flatten
serves as a connection between the convolution and dense layers.

5. Dense is the layer type we will use in our output layer. Dense is a standard layer
type.
6. The activation is softmax. Softmax makes the output sum up to 1 so the output
can be interpreted as probabilities. The model will then make its prediction based
on which option has the highest probability.
7. Compiling the model takes three parameters: optimiser, loss and metrics.
